# QueryCraft

QueryCraft is a project designed to replicate the front-end functionalities of Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.

### Description

This project is a front-end for three types of searches similar to Google's services. Users can navigate between regular Google Search, Image Search, and Advanced Search pages. Each page offers functionalities that mirror Google's search capabilities, allowing for an immersive and intuitive search experience.

### Getting Started

Navigate to the `index.html` file to start the project.

### Specification

#### Index

- **Google Search Page (index.html)**: This page contains a centered search bar and a "Google Search" button. Users can type in a query and click "Google Search" to view search results. There are also links in the upper-right corner to navigate to the Image Search and Advanced Search pages.

#### Image Search

- **Google Image Search Page**: Users can input a query and click the search button to view Google Image search results. A link in the upper-right corner allows users to navigate back to the Google Search page.

#### Advanced Search

- **Google Advanced Search Page**: This page includes four input fields to refine search queries:
  - "all these words"
  - "this exact word or phrase"
  - "any of these words"
  - "none of these words"

  Clicking the "Advanced Search" button takes users to the search results page for their specified query.

#### Additional Feature

- **"I'm Feeling Lucky" Button**: On the main Google Search page, this button takes users directly to the first Google search result for their query, bypassing the standard results page.

### CSS and Design

The CSS used in this project closely resembles Google's own aesthetics, providing a familiar and clean user interface.
